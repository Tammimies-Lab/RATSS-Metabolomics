## Analysis Pipeline

Thank you for showing interest in our manuscript. In this GitHub repository you will find the source code required to replicate our figures using R. In accordance with our Ethical approval and health data management requirements, we are unable to share patient information in the public domain.

### Differential Metabolomics

The the R Markdown file required for differential metabolomics analysis is included in this repository. Please refer to the methods section of the manuscript for details regarding the steps followed. In brief, differential metabolomic analysis for 208 metabolites was performed in the study cohort (N=105) using the *drgee* package in R, for overall effects and differences within twin-pairs using generalised estimating equations (GEE) models with suitable covariates.
